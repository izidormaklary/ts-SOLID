# Single responsibility principle

## Task

- change the "god object" in old.ts, to smaller objects, with single responsibility.

### Progress

- already have all the objects ( maybe one too many)
- fully functional
- question is: is the handling of fuel good this way:
    * the value is still controlled with a car object function
