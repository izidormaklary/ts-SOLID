# Single responsibility principle

## Task

- change the "god object" in old.ts, to smaller objects, with single responsibility.

### Progress

- [already have all the objects](https://github.com/izidormaklary/ts-SOLID/commit/234426e196ae01eb5c25f1bccdb0c09b5bffcd05)  ( maybe one too many)
- fully functional
- question is: is the handling of fuel good this way:
    * the value is still controlled with a car object function
  
- changed car class and the new script
- [at this point the assignment is done without extras](https://github.com/izidormaklary/ts-SOLID/commit/b2f4661bd3c08e8f69bdece6c6324973bd637e39)
